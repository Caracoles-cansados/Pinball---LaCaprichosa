## What is La Capricciosa?
La Capricciosa is basically a pinball game, the main theme is an Italian pizzeria. We have several physical functions used by box2. For example, the spring to start the game, the bouncers that every pinball machine has and flippers to hit the ball. Additionally, we have another physical function without using box2d. It is a kind of central roulette, that when passing the ball over it, the direction of the ball will change.
You have 3 lives, and every 6 thermometer points (hit the pepperoni) you get a total point. Try to get as many total points as possible!
